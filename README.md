 MUST-HAVE
In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here)
On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
The application must be responsive and mobile friendly
ðŸ’¡ Not sure where to start? Split this features into multiple smaller todos (in your code, sketch, ...)

NICE TO HAVE

Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js
Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities
Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.


You call an api using a URL:

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Brussels&appid=cbc16f0f5aa36c366d6f598260b41240;

You can query it further using a structure like & _ =

api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Brussels &time=14h51 &appid=insertkeyhere;


You now have .json data; i.e. a bunch of data set into an array.
